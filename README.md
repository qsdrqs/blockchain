# A blockchain implementation use modified DPoS consensus mechanism

Under development

## Contributing
1. Dependencies can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and can be updated with `pip frozen > requirements.txt` when bring in new dependencies.
2. Finish the code by implementing the functions with 'pass' or 'TODO' (Can use global search to find them)
3. Use autopep8 to format the code (should be integrated in most of Python development tools, just open auto format in your IDEs)
4. Use `skeleton.py` when creating new files
5. Good to do: `FIXME` is some where that may have performance issues.
